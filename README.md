<h2>About me</h2>

My main focus is Typescript/Node but I dabble in Python, Java.  I enjoy spending time messing around coding and seeing what I can come up with.

I've worked in frontend development, backend development, mobile development, infra and automation.

Right now I really enjoy prototyping things quickly with NextJS.

<h2>How to reach me</h2>

I'm always interested in talking about coding.  So whether you'd like to talk about working together or just software development in general, reach out to me.
