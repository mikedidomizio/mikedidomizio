I'm a developer that loves coding 🖥️ , boxing 🥊, video games 🎮, fitness 💪, and sports cars 🏎️.  My main focus is Javascript but I dabble in Python, Java and Go.  I have worked on frontend work, backend work, mobile apps, electron apps.  I am that guy that spends hours coding something that takes 5 mins to do occasionally.

The best way to chat with me is Twitter:
