My main focus is Typescript/Node but I dabble in Python, Java.  I enjoy spending time messing around coding and seeing what I can come up with.

I've worked in frontend development, backend development, mobile development, infra and automation.

Right now I really enjoy prototyping things quickly with NextJS.

<h3>What I've recently been working on</h3>

- [LaunchDorkly](https://github.com/mikedidomizio/launchdorkly) - A different or power user approach to a UI for LaunchDarkly.
- [PartyKit](https://github.com/mikedidomizio/partykit-chat) - Using PartyKit/NextJS, a concept for building different socket layers using React Context.
- [Transcriber Summarizer](https://github.com/mikedidomizio/transcriber-summarizer) - Summarize audio with AWS Transcribe and get a breakdown via OpenAI
